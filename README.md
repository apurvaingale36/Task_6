readme_content = """# Password Strength Evaluation Report

## Objective
Understand what makes a password strong by creating multiple passwords with varying complexity, testing them using online password strength checkers, and analyzing the results to determine best practices.

---

## Methodology

1. **Created multiple passwords** with different combinations of:
   - Uppercase and lowercase letters
   - Numbers
   - Symbols
   - Varying lengths  
2. **Tested each password** using [PasswordMeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com).  
3. **Recorded** scores, strength ratings, and feedback.  
4. **Researched** common password attacks and how complexity impacts security.

---

## Results

| Password | Score (%) | Strength | Feedback |
|----------|-----------|----------|----------|
| `apple123` | 30% | Weak | Too short, predictable, lacks symbols |
| `ApPle2025` | 54% | Medium | Needs more symbols and length |
| `ApPlE@2025!` | 80% | Strong | Good mix, slightly short |
| `T!m3_Trav3l@Galaxy99` | 98% | Very Strong | Excellent mix and length |
| `P@55W0rD!!**SuperStrong987` | 100% | Very Strong | Long, unpredictable, diverse characters |

## Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords

- **Length matters** — aim for **12–16+ characters**.  
- **Mix character types** — uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.  
- **Avoid dictionary words** or common patterns.  
- **Use passphrases** that are unique but memorable.  
- **Never reuse passwords** across accounts.  
- **Use a password manager** to store and generate strong passwords.

## Common Password Attacks

| Attack Type | Description | Prevention |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| **Brute Force** | Tries all possible combinations until the correct password is found. | Use long and complex passwords. |
| **Dictionary Attack** | Uses a precompiled list of common words/passwords. | Avoid dictionary words and predictable patterns. |
| **Credential Stuffing** | Uses stolen login credentials on multiple sites. | Use unique passwords for every site. |
| **Phishing** | Tricks you into revealing your password. | Stay alert for suspicious emails and links. |

---

## Conclusion

Password strength is determined by **length**, **complexity**, and **uniqueness**.  
Short or simple passwords are vulnerable to brute force and dictionary attacks.  
A combination of strong passwords and **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** provides the highest security.
